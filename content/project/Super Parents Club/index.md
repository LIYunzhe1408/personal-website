The program aims to convey modern education concepts and pay attention to the common growth of parents and children. The famous teachers and education experts who attend each session of the Parents' meeting will provide parents with the most professional education concepts and information. In the expression of the story as the core element, through the way of investigation to tell the education hot events and real help cases, at the same time through the experience sharing between parents and children's perspectives of multiple observations, reflecting the slogan of the program - "Parents study hard, children make progress every day".

We propose our chassis inspired from FTC competition and competed with real driver to stimulate the scene of parking.

In this episode, we mainly share our experience in STEAM, especailly in robotics. We encourage young students from different backgrounds to engage in STEAM, creating their own future.
