1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,733
Looks like it's hanging

2
00:00:01,733 --> 00:00:03,000
Yeah, did you see that

3
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:04,400
So how do you move it

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,666
We're going to switch to his chassis motion right now

5
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:08,766
Uh, it's forward

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,766
This is back

7
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:11,966
The chassis can also go back and forth

8
00:00:11,966 --> 00:00:13,100
Yeah, and then this is a shift to the left

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,166
Oh oh

10
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:19,966
It also supports rotating in place

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,200
Oh

12
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:23,666
Well, I don't think it's that much trouble

13
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:24,399
If I'm a good driver

14
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,200
I don't need this.

15
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,533
Why don't we have a game or something

16
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:29,300
Well.

17
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,566
Actually came to our scene today

18
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:31,700
How do you compete

19
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,333
How do you compete in your field

20
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,733
It's just a lateral shift

21
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:35,333
You are familiar with

22
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,166
It's just two cars parked here

23
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:39,733
Leave a space for another car

24
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:42,333
Um, can we just time it

25
00:00:46,533 --> 00:00:47,600
Whoa, slow down

26
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,400
Oh, my gosh

27
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,333
Whoops whoops

28
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:51,800
Lose money, lose money

29
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:53,266
Oh boy

30
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:56,566
Insurance. Insurance company. Oops

31
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,800
This kid never got his driver's license

32
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:04,400
We're going to switch the vehicle from normal to parking

33
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:08,233
and then we're going to put the Mcnamum wheel down

34
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,300
Turn in place first

35
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,766
It's much steadier

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,500
It's steady

37
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,800
It's a second kill. Haha

38
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:26,766
hawa

39
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,166
Model car team

40
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,566
I wonder if you were working with them on purpose

41
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,200
It's hard, isn't it

42
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,166
Reverse into the garage

43
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,466
We looked at a traditional reverse mode

44
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:38,333
and a new way to perform a PK

45
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:42,566
It has nothing to do with the technology of their operation

46
00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:45,166
It just has to do with the laws of physics

47
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:46,866
Because when you pulled over

48
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:49,100
You have a four-wheel design like this

49
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,366
When you need to park

50
00:01:50,366 --> 00:01:51,300
You need to park it

51
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,066
He must have space
